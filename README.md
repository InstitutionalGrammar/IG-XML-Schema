# IG-XML-Schema
XML Schema for the Institutional Grammar 2.0 (IG 2.0)

Status: Work in progress (Version: 20201029)

This schema seeks alignment with the [IG 2.0 Specification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08937/) and includes the following features:

 * constitutive and regulative statements
 * statement-level nesting, including nesting on consequence (vertical nesting) and statement combinations (horizontal nesting), as well as compound consequences
 * component-level nesting (both including institutional statements and statements of fact)
 * individual properties and property hierarchy on selected components
 
The schema assumes the decomposition of component-level combinations (e.g., multiple aims) into individual complete logically combined institutional statements. At the current stage, the schema furthermore focuses on the representation of structure; additional annotation attributes to capture semantic annotations are not included in the current version.

Work in progress:
 * Links to external statements, collections or documents
 * Support for semantic annotations (e.g., representation of context taxonomy categories, custom tags)
 * Meta information (e.g., links to underlying source)
 * Companion document schema to capture statement collections
