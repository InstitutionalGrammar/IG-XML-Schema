# IG-XML-Schema
XML Schema for the Institutional Grammar 2.0

This schema includes the following features:

 * constitutive and regulative statements
 * statement-level nesting
 * component-level nesting (both including institutional statements and statements of fact)
 
The schema assumes the decomposition of component-level combinations (e.g., multiple aims) into individual complete logically combined institutional statements. At the current stage, the schema furthermore focuses on the representation of structure; additional annotation attributes to capture semantic annotations are not included in the current version.
